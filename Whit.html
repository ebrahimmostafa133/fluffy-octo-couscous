            <p><h1>What Is Information Technology?</h1></p>
            <p><big>In order to understand how information technology is helping us through the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to recognize what IT encompasses. 
                Information technology (IT) is a broad field that covers all functions and processes relating to computers or technology in an organization or business. 
                It is often used to refer to computers and networks, but it encompasses an enormous scope of work that handles technological problems in companies, institutions, or any other organizations that manage information. 
                IT includes all aspects of sharing information over a variety of networks and the internet as a whole. 
                These include physical hardware, operating systems, applications, storage, databases, servers e.t.c.

                Information technology has gone through many breakthroughs and advancements over the last couple of years and has infiltrated every part of our daily lives. 
                As it provides convenience and makes our lives easier, we find ourselves investing more resources into upgrading and keeping it around. 
                This has definitely paid off during difficult times because it makes things much more manageable in times of crisis. 
                Many people underestimate just how widespread information technology has become; this could be a simple case of growing accustomed to IT and everything it has to offer. 
                These are the ways IT helps us during the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.</big></p>
