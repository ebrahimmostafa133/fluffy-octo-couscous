            <p><h1>Using Technology to Fight the Virus</h1></p>
        <p><big>The immediate objective around the world is to suppress the virus, which means detecting it quickly and breaking the chain of transmission. For those who have contracted the virus and become unwell, we will need treatments for potentially life-threatening conditions. And in the long run, the goal is of course a vaccine.

            Much of this work is the domain of medical experts and clinicians, scientists and epidemiologists. The role of technology is to support them in their work, and where possible to give them new tools, new options and new ways to go further, faster.
            
            We know, for example, that extensive testing and rigorous contact tracing is an essential part of the suppression strategy. Traditionally contract tracing is done by interviewing people who have tested positive, in order to piece together a picture of who else may have been exposed. This procedure can be unreliable, however, and is very labour intensive.
            
            In Singapore, the government’s Trace Together app takes advantage of the Bluetooth functionality of modern smartphones to detect and securely record when two devices have been in close proximity. When someone who has been using the app tests positive for Covid-19 they are asked to share their data, which in turn can be used to alert other people who may have been near them recently.
            
            On the issue of mass-testing – which is essential to returning to a state of normality by easing widespread lockdowns and social-distancing measures – technology can be harnessed to help scale-up rapid-testing capabilities, and new digital tools will be vital to support the delivery of large-scale community testing and to triage cases.
            
            There are many other applications of technology in the fight against the virus. On the hardware front, technology can support everything from searching for equipment suppliers and distributing tests and medicines quickly, through to 3D printing emergency valves for ventilators.
            
            Back in the digital realm, other applications range from using machine learning to spot and predict patterns, through to providing digital “immunity passports” for people who have had the virus and the epurposing of existing digital apps and services to share public-health information and serve patients.

            Technology also has a powerful role to play in organising collaboration between technologists and practitioners; the Coronavirus Tech Handbook is one example of how massive, decentralised participation can be made possible by technology.</big></p>
