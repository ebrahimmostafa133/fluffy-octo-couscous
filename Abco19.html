        <p><h1>About Covid-19</h1></p>
            <p><big>Scientists believe that the 19-COVID virus, announced by China on 12/31/2019, has passed from bats to humans. The danger of this virus is that it is rapidly spreading, 
                in addition to the long incubation period of the virus.  

                The incubation period for the virus is the period before the symptoms appear on the person who has the virus. This period may reach 14 days.
                 During this period, the affected person is a source of infection without knowing it.
               
               How is corona’s disease spread
               
                The Corona virus spreads from one person to another by touching a healthy person’s droplet of a person who has the virus. 
                Therefore, the mask must be used, especially for the affected person. We should not be in crowded places, and washing hands often with soap and water.
               
                The Corona virus has spread in all countries of the world as a result of the travel of some people infected with the virus to other countries and mixing with others.</big></p>
